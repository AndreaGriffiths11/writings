One of the most rewarding things i’ve ever done in my life was take the plunge to pursuit the career path I’ve always dreamt of, it has not been easy and yes there have been challenges along the way but being a professional in the Tech space has for me been a dream come true. There are lot or reasons to switch careers later in life: money, convenience, and a shift in priorities are all driving factors when considering to take the leap, I’ve had the pleasure to work with some brilliant folks and they all have one common demominatior yes they like making money but for most what they do comes engrained with a passion that can not be bought. It’s truly a labor of love.

In the tech space I have now worked for two compant with very differetn mission yet a very powerful social responsibility and ownership. My ultimate goal in life is to live a life of service to other to help give a voice to unerrepresentat populations to help lift others up.
